## Downloading MacOS Installers via Terminal

Mac users can download the latest macOS installer available from the Terminal by using the following command string:
`softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer`

You can also download specific installer versions by using the following syntax, replacing the asterisks with version number:
`softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version **.**.*`

For example, to get macOS 11.2.1 the syntax would be as follows:
`softwareupdate --fetch-full-installer --full-installer-version 11.2.1`

### Downloading Mac OS X Installers from App Store “Purchases”

If you had at one point in time purchased or downloaded a version of MacOS or Mac OS X from the Mac App Store, then you should be able to re-download it from the Mac App Store by going go the *Purchases* section. This can typically be used to access downloads for installers though there are some exceptions.
- for MacOS Mojave
- High Sierra
- Sierra
- Mavericks
- Mountain Lion

1. Open the App Store
2. Go to the “Purchases” section (newer App Store versions must go to Account &gt; Purchases)
3. Scroll down the list of Purchased items to locate the Mac OS X Installer version you wish to re-download, then click on the download button

This works particularly well if the Mac you’re downloading the software onto is running an older version of Mac OS X.
